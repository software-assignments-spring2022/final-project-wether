1. Always push working code, if you break the pipeline/build then fix it.
1. Make granular and small commits, per feature or per bug fix.
1. Provide descriptive commit messages.
1. Write self documenting code. Use descriptive variable and function names. Avoid unnecessary name shortening.
1. Don't leave dead/commented out code behind. If you see such code, delete it.
