## Project History

[Contributing MD](CONTRIBUTING.md)

From Brad Feng: 

It's like "weather" but with "we" since everyone contributes.

The idea is a crowdsourced weather app for what the weather is like in real time in your area.
There can be questions like "Are there puddles?" or "Is there a lot of snow?", or even "Do you need allergy meds?"

Maybe my weather app says it's raining, but its actaully not where I am.
Or maybe it snowed last night, and I want to know how much snow is on the ground to decide whether or not I need boots. (since the prediction can be off)
Maybe I'm allergic to pollen (I am) and want to know when to start taking meds without having to suffer for the first day.
Sometimes info more detailed than the forecast is nice

People who want more info than what a normal weather app gives. This can be anyone who's planning to go outside and wants to be prepared. The app can also provide a normal weather forecast, so it can replace users' normal weather apps.

## Building and Testing

TBD
